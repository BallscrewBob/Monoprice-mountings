# Monoprice-mountings
STL, SKETCHUP, 3MF files for new hotend mounts.

POWER DOWN YOUR PRINTER !

Remove carriage from printer by slacken belt tension bolt and disconnect the belt.
Remove nuts from top two wheels.
Tilt forward at top of carriage and remove it.
Remove the three magnets as they will no longer be needed. 

Mount bare hotend to  3D part minus the bowden connector. I also used two small washers as spacers between the hot end and the 3D part (important)
Mount 3D part to carriage and ensure the screws do not interfere with the track by offering it up to TEST FIT.

Mount fans using suitable screws. NOTE the cooling fan main outlet is in the wrong place but I will create a new part for that at a later point.
If you printed a SLED then you can re-mount the proximity sensor to that sled and mount the sled on the left of the main 3d part.
If you leave the sensor on the fan it will require new offsets (dont ask me how)

Hopefully at this point you will have something that resembles a complete new head.
Reverse the  dissasembly process and double check your work.
Ensure the carriage can move freely
Power up the printer and use the MOVE buttons to check that it moves as it should.
Minor adjustments may be needed to the lower wheel of the carriage and or belt tension.
